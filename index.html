							different organizations;</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>to provide finalized packaged Publications from a publisher or conversion house to different distribution or
							sales channels; and</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>to deliver packaged Publications to users or user agents.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>to package a specific subset of Web Publications.</p>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p>In addition, the following terminology is defined for use in this specification:</p>

				<dl class="termlist">
					<dt><dfn id="dfn-codec">Codec</dfn></dt>
					<dd>
						<p>Codec refers to content types that has intrinsic binary format qualities, such as video and audio media types which are already designed for optimum compression, or which provide optimized streaming capabilities.</p>
					</dd>
					<dt><dfn id="dfn-non-codec">Non-Codec</dfn></dt>

			<h1>Specification</h1>

			<section id="sec-zip">

					<h2>Packaging format</h2>

					<p>A <dfn data-lt="Lightweight Packaging Format">Lightweight Publication Package</dfn> uses the ZIP format as specified in ISO/IEC 21320-1:2015 ([[zip]]).</p>

			</section>

			<section id="sec-structure">
		
					<h2>File and Directory Structure</h2>

					<p>A <a>Package</a> MUST include at least one of the following files in the <a>Root Directory</a>:</p>
						
					<ul>
							<li>A file named <code>publication.json</code>, 
								which MUST be in the format defined for <a>Publication Manifests</a>.</li>
						<li>A file named <code>index.html</code> which MUST follow the requirements of the 
							<a>Primary Entry Page</a> of a Web Publication.</li>
						</ul>
	
					<p>The contents of both files are specified in [[wpub]]; they MUST not be encrypted.</p>

					<p>A Package MUST also include all resources within the bounds of the Publication, i.e. the finite set of resources obtained from the union of resources listed in the default reading order and resource list of the Publication Manifest.</p>

					<p>These resource files MAY be in any location descendant from the Root Directory.</p>

					<p>Files within the Package MUST reference each other via relative paths, resolving to resources 
						within the Package (i.e. at or below the <a>Root Directory</a>).</p>
		
					<div class="note">
							<p>The [[zip]] specification has few constraints on the characters allowed for file and directory names. 
								When crafting such names, authors must be careful to use characters which 
								allow a broad interoperability among operating systems and are compatible with relative paths.</p>
					</div>
	
			</section>
		
			<section id="sec-compression">
		
					<h2>Compression of resources</h2>

					<p>When stored in a Package, resources with <a>Non-Codec</a> content types SHOULD be compressed and the Deflate compression algorithm MUST be used. This practice ensures that file entries stored in the Package have a smaller size.</p>

					<p>Resources with <a>Codec</a> content types SHOULD be stored without compression. In such case, compression would introduce unnecessary processing overhead at production time (especially with large resource files) and would impact audio/video playback performance at consumption time.</p>

					<div class="note">
							<p>In some cases, the combination of compression with some encryption schemes might 
								even hinder the ability of user agents to handle partial content requests 
								(e.g. HTTP byte ranges), due to the technical	difficulty to determine the length 
								of the full resource ahead of media playback (e.g. HTTP Content-Length header).</p>
					</div>

			<section id="sec-obtaining-manifest">

				<h2>Obtaining a Publication Manifest</h2>		

				<p>If the Package contains a <code>publication.json</code> file 
					located in the <a>Root Directory</a>, the Publication Manifest is obtained by opening and parsing this file.</p>
	
				<p>Otherwise, if the Package contains an <code>index.html</code> file in the <a>Root Directory</a>, 	the Publication Manifest is obtained through the following steps:</p>

				<ol>
						<li>Let <code>Document</code> be the result of the extraction of the <code>index.html</code> file from the Package.</li>

						<li>If it does not have the media type <code>text/html</code> or
								<code>application/xhtml+xml</code>, terminate this algorithm.</li>

						<li>Let <var>manifest link</var> be the first <code>link</code> element 
							in tree order in <code>Document</code> whose
								<code>rel</code> attribute contains the <code>publication</code> token. </li>

						<li>If <var>manifest link</var> is <code>null</code>, terminate this algorithm. </li>

						<li>If <var>manifest link</var>'s <code>href</code> attribute's value is the empty string,
							terminate this algorithm. </li>

						<li>
							<p>If the <code>href</code> attribute value of <var>manifest link</var> has a non-null <a data-cite="!url#concept-url-fragment">fragment</a>
								identifying an identifier <var>id</var> in <code>Document</code>:</p>
							<ol>
								<li>Let <var>embedded manifest script</var> be the first <code>script</code>
									element in tree order, whose <code>id</code> attribute is equal to
										<var>id</var> and whose <code>type</code> attribute is equal to
										<code>application/ld+json</code>.</li>

								<li>If <var>embedded manifest script</var> is <code>null</code>, terminate this
									algorithm.</li>

								<li>Let <var>text</var> be the
									 <a data-cite="!dom#concept-child-text-content">child text content</a> 
									 of <var>embedded manifest script</var></li>
							</ol>
							<details>
									<summary>Explanation</summary>
									<p>This branch is in use when the manifest is embedded in the primary entry page. The
										algorithm locates the <code>script</code> element and extract the manifest itself.</p>
								</details>
						</li>
						<li>Otherwise: <ol>
								<li>Let <var>manifest path</var> be the value of the <code>href</code> attribute. </li>
								<li>If <var>manifest path</var> is not a relative path, then abort these steps. </li>
								<li>Extract the Manifest from the Package using <var>manifest path</var>. </li>
								<li>Open and read the Manifest file, letting <var>text</var> be the result. </li>
							</ol>
							<details>
								<summary>Explanation</summary>
								<p>This branch is in use when the manifest is in a separate file. It performs the
									standard operations to retrieve the manifest from the Package.</p>
							</details>
						</li>
				</ol>
		
				<p>If both <code>index.html</code> and <code>publication.json</code> are present in the Package, then the Primary Entry Page SHOULD contain a reference to the <code>publication.json</code> file, following the rules defined in this section.</p>

				<aside class="example">
					<p>Here, the <a>Publication Manifest</a> is named <code>publication.json</code>, 
						and located in the <a>Root Directory</a>. 
						It is simply referenced from the <a>Primary Entry Page</a> via an [[HTML]] <code>link</code> element.</p>
					<pre>
&lt;link href="publication.json" rel="publication"/&gt;
					</pre>

					<h2>User Agent Conformance</h2>
		
					<p>A user agent conforms to this specification if it meets the following criteria:</p>
		
					<ul class="conformance-list">
							<li>It is capable of exploiting the archive format and file structure from a <a href="#sec-specification">conforming Package</a>.
							</li>
							<li>It is capable of <a href="#sec-obtaining-manifest">obtaining a

						</li>
						<li>It is capable of extracting a Table of Contents and a Page List from the Primary Entry Page 
							(when present in the Package), 
							as specified in <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wpub/#wp-toc-processing">Web Publications - 
							Extracting a Table of Contents</a> and

			<h2>The <code>application/lpf+zip</code> Media Type</h2>

			<p>This appendix registers the media type <code>application/lpf+zip</code> 
				for the Lightweight Packaging Format (LPF).</p>

			<p>A <a>Lightweight Packaging Format</a> (or LPF) file is a container technology based on the
				[[zip]] archive format. It is used to encapsulate Web Publications. 
				LPF and its related standards are maintained and defined by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).</p>

			<dl class="variablelist">

				<dt>Encoding considerations:</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>LPF files are binary files encoded in the <a class="media-type"
							href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/application/zip">
							<code>application/zip</code></a> media type.</p>
				</dd>
				<dt>Security considerations:</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>User agents that read LPF files should rigorously check the size 
						and validity of data retrieved.</p>
					<p>In addition, because of the various content types that can be embedded in LPF files
						, <code>application/lpf+zip</code> may describe content that poses security implications
						beyond those noted here. However, only in cases where the user agent recognizes and processes the
						additional content, or where further processing of that content is dispatched to other
						user agents, would security issues potentially arise. In such cases, matters of security would
						fall outside the domain of this registration document.</p>
					<p>Security considerations that apply to <code>application/zip</code> also apply to LPF files.</p>
				</dd>
				<dt>Interoperability considerations:</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>Any format based on LPF, if using content encryption, MUST choose a different  
							MIME media type and file extension than those defined in this specification.</p>
				</dd>
				<dt>Published specification:</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>This media type registration is for the Lightweight Packaging Format (LPF), 
						as described by the	Lightweight Packaging Format (LPF) specification located at <a
							href="https://w3c.github.io/lpf/"
								><code>https://w3c.github.io/lpf/</code></a>.</p>
				</dd>
				<dt>Applications that use this media type:</dt>
