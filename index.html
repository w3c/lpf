			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<p>A digital publication Package is used:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>To exchange in-progress packaged publications between different individuals and/or
							different organizations;</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>To provide finalized packaged publications from a publisher or conversion house 
						to different distribution or sales channels; and</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>To deliver packaged publications to users or user agents.</p>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p>This specification is based on proven technologies and allows digital publications

				<h1>Packaging format</h1>

				<p>For packaging the set of constituent	resources and associated metadata 
				that comprise a digital publication, this specification uses the ZIP format 
				as specified in ISO/IEC 21320-1:2015 ([[ISO21320]] and [[zip]]).</p>

		</section>

		<section class="informative" id="sec-compression">
	
				<h1>Compression of resources</h1>

				<p>When stored in a Package, resources with <a>Non-Codec content types</a> SHOULD be compressed and the Deflate compression algorithm MUST be used. This practice ensures that file entries stored in the Package have a smaller size.</p>

				<p>Resources with <a>Codec content types</a> SHOULD be stored without compression. In such case, compression would introduce unnecessary processing overhead at production time (especially with large resource files) and would impact audio/video playback performance at consumption time.</p>

				<div class="note">
						<p>In some cases, the combination of compression with some encryption schemes might 
							even hinder the ability of user agents to handle partial content requests 
							(e.g. HTTP byte ranges), due to the technical	difficulty to determine the length 
							of the full resource ahead of media playback (e.g. HTTP Content-Length header).</p>
				</div>

		</section>

		<section class="informative" id="sec-structure">
	
				<h1>File and Directory Structure</h1>

				<p>A <a>Package</a> MUST include at least one of the following files in its <a>Root Directory</a>:</p>
					
				<ul>
						<li>A file named <code>publication.json</code>, 
							which MUST be in the format defined for <a>Publication Manifests</a>.</li>
					<li>A file named <code>index.html</code> which MUST follow the requirements of the 
						<a>Primary Entry Page</a> of a digital publication.</li>
					</ul>

				<p>The Root Directory is virtual in nature: a user agent might or might 
						not generate a physical root directory for the contents of the 
						Package if such contents are unpackaged.</p>

				<p>The contents of both files MUST not be encrypted.</p>

				<p>A Package MUST also include all resources within the bounds of the digital publication, 
				i.e. the finite set of resources obtained from the union of resources listed 
				in the default reading order and resource list of the Publication Manifest.</p>

				<p>These resource files MAY be in any location descendant from the Root Directory, or in the Root Directory itself.</p>

				<p>Contents within the Package MUST reference these resources via relative-URL strings [[url]].</p>
	
				<div class="note">
						<p>The [[zip]] specification has few constraints on the characters allowed 
							for file and directory names. 
							When crafting such names, authors must be careful to use characters which 
							allow a broad interoperability among operating systems.</p>
				</div>

			<h1>Obtaining a Publication Manifest</h1>		

			<p>If the Package contains a <code>publication.json</code> file 
				located in the Root Directory, 
				the Publication Manifest is obtained by	opening and parsing this file.</p>

			<p>Otherwise, if the Package contains an <code>index.html</code> file
				located in the Root Directory, 
				the Publication Manifest is obtained through the following steps:</p>

			<ol>
					<li>Let <code>document</code> be the result of the extraction of the <code>index.html</code> 
					file from the Package.</li>

					<li>If it does not have the media type <code>text/html</code> or
							<code>application/xhtml+xml</code>, terminate this algorithm.</li>

					<li>Let <var>manifest link</var> be the first <code>link</code> element 
						in tree order in <code>document</code> whose
						<code>rel</code> attribute contains the <code>publication</code> token. </li>

					<li>If <var>manifest link</var> is <code>null</code>, terminate this algorithm. </li>

					<li>If <var>manifest link</var>'s <code>href</code> attribute's value is the empty string,
						terminate this algorithm. </li>

					<li>
						<p>If the <code>href</code> attribute value of <var>manifest link</var> has a non-null <a data-cite="!url#concept-url-fragment">fragment</a>
							identifying an identifier <var>id</var> in <code>document</code>:</p>
						<ol>
							<li>Let <var>embedded manifest script</var> be the first <code>script</code>
								element in tree order, whose <code>id</code> attribute is equal to
									<var>id</var> and whose <code>type</code> attribute is equal to
									<code>application/ld+json</code>.</li>

							<li>If <var>embedded manifest script</var> is <code>null</code>, terminate this
								algorithm.</li>

							<li>Let <var>manifest text</var> be the
									<a data-cite="!dom#concept-child-text-content">child text content</a> 
									of <var>embedded manifest script</var></li>
						</ol>
						<details>
								<summary>Explanation</summary>
								<p>This branch is in use when the manifest is embedded in the primary entry page. The
									algorithm locates the <code>script</code> element and extract the manifest itself.</p>
							</details>
					</li>
					<li>Otherwise: <ol>
							<li>Let <var>manifest URL</var> be the value of the <code>href</code> attribute. </li>
							<li>If <var>manifest URL</var> is not a relative URL string, then abort these steps. </li>
							<li>Extract the Manifest from the Package using <var>manifest URL</var>. </li>
							<li>Open and read the Manifest file, letting <var>manifest text</var> be the result. </li>
						</ol>
						<details>
							<summary>Explanation</summary>
							<p>This branch is in use when the manifest is in a separate file. It performs the
								standard operations to retrieve the manifest from the Package.</p>
						</details>
					</li>
			</ol>
	
			<p>If both <code>index.html</code> and <code>publication.json</code> are present in the Package, 
			then the Primary Entry Page SHOULD contain a reference to the <code>publication.json</code> file, 
			following the rules defined in this section.</p>

			<aside class="example">
				<p>Here, the Publication Manifest, located into the Root Directory, 
					is simply referenced from the Primary Entry Page via 
					an [[HTML]] <code>link</code> element.</p>
				<pre>
&lt;link href="publication.json" rel="publication"/&gt;
				</pre>
				<p>An example of a Primary Entry Page embedding a Publication Manifest is given in [[audiobooks]].

			<h1>The <code>application/lpf+zip</code> Media Type</h1>

			<p>This appendix registers the media type <code>application/lpf+zip</code> 
				for the Lightweight Packaging Format (LPF).</p>

			<p>Lightweight Packaging Format (or LPF) is a container technology 
				based on the [[zip]] archive format, 
				used for packaging into a single-file container the set of related resources 
				and associated metadata that comprise a digital publication . 
				LPF and its related standards are maintained and defined by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).</p>

				<dt>Security considerations:</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>User agents that read LPF files should rigorously check the size

					<p>In addition, because of the various content types that can be embedded in LPF files
						, <code>application/lpf+zip</code> may describe content that poses security implications
						beyond those noted here. However, only in cases where the user agent recognizes and processes the
						additional content, or where further processing of that content is dispatched to other
						user agents, would security issues potentially arise. In such cases, matters of security would
						fall outside the domain of this registration document.</p>
					<p>Security considerations that apply to <code>application/zip</code> also apply to LPF files.</p>
				</dd>
				<dt>Interoperability considerations:</dt>
